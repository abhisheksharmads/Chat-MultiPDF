# MultiPDF Chat App: Interactive Querying for Multiple PDFs

## Introduction
The MultiPDF Chat App is an intuitive Python-based solution that enables real-time, natural language interactions with multiple PDF documents. Built on cutting-edge language model technology, this application offers precise answers to your questions based on the content within the loaded PDF files. Please note that the application specializes in answering questions specifically related to the content of the PDFs you have loaded.

## How the App Functions
The MultiPDF Chat App employs a multi-step approach to deliver accurate and relevant responses:

1. **PDF Loading**: The application ingests multiple PDF files and extracts the textual content for analysis.
  
2. **Text Segmentation**: The extracted text is then segmented into manageable chunks to facilitate efficient processing.

3. **Textual Analysis via Language Model**: These text chunks are processed through a language model to create vector embeddings that encapsulate their semantic content.

4. **Semantic Matching**: Upon receiving a query, the application performs a semantic similarity comparison between the query and the available text chunks.

5. **Intelligent Response Generation**: The semantically relevant text chunks are fed back into the language model, which then formulates an appropriate response based on the PDF content.
